# WitP:AE base editor

A small savegame editor for War in the Pacific: Admiral's Edition, focused on
bases. Python 3.8+, standard library only (tkinter for the GUI).

## Run

    python witpae_editor.py [path\to\save.pws]

File > Open defaults to `..\SAVE`. Pick a base, edit its fields, press Apply
(edited rows are highlighted), then File > Save As. Saving over an existing
file asks first and copies the old file to `<name>.bak`. The save title can
also be edited (under 1000 bytes, latin-1).

Tests: `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`

## Fields

| Field | Status |
|---|---|
| Supply, Fuel, Resource storage, Oil storage, Port size, Airfield size, Forts | verified in-game, editable |
| Ships in port, Aircraft at base | verified, display only |

Name, side and hex coordinates are read-only. The field table is in
`witpae/bases.py`; adding a field is one line.

## Backups

Always keep a copy of your saves before editing. Prefer saving to a new file
name rather than over the original, and test unverified fields on a copy.
